This is a sample technical post. It demonstrates:
- syntax-highlighted code blocks
- inline and block math (LaTeX/MathJax)
- an illustrative figure with a caption

You can use the same structure for more serious technical writing and export the same `.qmd` to PDF.

## Code Example

Below is a small Python snippet showing a Stable Softplus implementation (for numerical stability) and a simple mean-squared-error:

```python
import math

def softplus(x: float) -> float:
    # Stable softplus: log(1 + exp(x))
    if x > 20:
        return x  # exp(x) would overflow; asymptotically ~ x
    return math.log1p(math.exp(x))

def mse(y_true, y_pred):
    n = len(y_true)
    return sum((a - b)**2 for a, b in zip(y_true, y_pred)) / n

print(softplus(0.0))
print(mse([1, 2, 3], [1.1, 2.2, 2.9]))
```

## Inline Math

We denote a model’s parameters by $\theta$ and a dataset by $\mathcal{D}$. A typical objective may minimize a loss $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$ with gradient $\nabla_\theta \, \mathcal{L}(\theta)$.

## Block Math

For example, the mean squared error (MSE) for targets $y_i$ and predictions $\hat y_i$ is

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta)
\;=\; \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \bigl(y_i - \hat y_i\bigr)^2
\,.
$$

Alternatively, a negative log-likelihood (NLL) under a Gaussian assumption ($\sigma^2$ fixed) is

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta)
\;=\; \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \bigl(y_i - \hat y_i\bigr)^2
\;+\; \text{const}.
$$

## Figure with Caption

Here is a placeholder image with a caption and constrained width:

## Summary

This post shows how to combine code, math, and figures in a single `.qmd`. The same source can be rendered to HTML for the blog and exported to PDF (via `quarto render post.qmd --to pdf`) as a chapter draft or paper section.
