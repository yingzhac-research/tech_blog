Welcome! This is a minimal post to confirm that listings, styling, and navigation work as expected.

Some inline code like `print("hello")` should be easy to read in dark mode.

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Quarto"))
```

That’s all for now — more technical posts coming soon.
