# TODO: NLP textbook audit plan (ch1-ch8)

## Inputs to collect
- Locate NLP-textbook-related skills under .claude/skills and list each SKILL.md.
- Extract explicit requirements, style constraints, and required resources from each skill into a checklist.

## Chapter scope
- Identify where chapter files live (ch1-ch8) and record their paths, titles, and language.
- Verify chapter numbering and confirm coverage is exactly ch1..ch8.

## Skill compliance review
- For each chapter, assess compliance against each skill requirement; mark pass/partial/fail with notes.
- Summarize gaps per chapter and cross-chapter patterns.

## Figures and pseudocode audit
- Inventory all images and algorithm/pseudocode boxes in ch1..ch8.
- For each item, record caption, location, and stated source/citation.
- Verify whether each image/pseudocode comes from a paper, book, or public course; flag missing/unclear attribution.

## Open resources usage
- From skills, list the open books and public courses that should be leveraged.
- Check whether each chapter uses or references these resources; note underused or missing resources.
- Propose where in ch1..ch8 these resources can be incorporated.

## Redundancy check
- Detect overlapping content across chapters (duplicated sections/examples/definitions).
- Recommend consolidation or reorganization to reduce repetition.

## Enrichment opportunities
- Identify key concepts, examples, or exercises missing from ch1..ch8 that are available in the open resources.
- Propose concrete additions (sections, figures, pseudocode, case studies) to strengthen the textbook.

## Deliverables (after review)
- A compliance matrix: chapters x skill requirements.
- An asset inventory: images/pseudocode with sources and attribution status.
- A gap/redundancy report with recommended fixes.
- A prioritized enrichment list with sources.
